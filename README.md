1. Make sure to clone the submodules. If you didn't clone the repository with `git clone --recursive`, you can download
the submodules by running `git submodule init && git submodule update`
2. Next, you need to create a symbolic link from the clogg/lib folder into the root folder. To do this, you can use `ln -sf clogg/lib lib`
